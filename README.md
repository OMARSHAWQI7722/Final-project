# C++ Basics Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive collection of C++ programs that cover various basic concepts, algorithms, and functionalities. The project is divided into sections with individual programs aimed at helping users learn and apply C++ in practical scenarios. Each section addresses key programming paradigms, such as sequence control, branching, and repetition.

The project includes two main sections:
- **Theoretical Section**: Programs to explore core concepts and control structures in C++.
- **Practical Section**: A variety of assignments and a final project containing more advanced programs.

## Features
### Theoretical Section
This section contains programs demonstrating:
1. Sequence Control Structures:
   - Calculate the area of a triangle.
   - Convert minutes to seconds.
   - Compute prices with tax.
2. Branching Control Structures:
   - Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - Determine the maximum of two numbers.
   - Identify whether a number is odd or even.
3. Repetition Control Structures:
   - Print names or numbers multiple times.
   - Display even numbers and calculate sums.
   - Generate multiplication tables.

### Practical Section
This section includes assignments and a **Final Project**, which covers the following programs:

#### Assignments
- Basic calculator operations.
- Compute areas of shapes (square, triangle).
- Identify vowels or consonants in a character.
- Sum odd numbers in a given list.

#### Final Project
1. Find the quotient between two numbers.
2. Determine ASCII values of characters.
3. Swap two numbers.
4. Calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle.
5. Convert kilometers per hour to miles per hour.
6. Print patterns like pyramids, diamonds, and Pascal's triangle.
7. Work with strings (concatenate, reverse, change case).
8. Generate Fibonacci series.
9. Perform matrix manipulations (reversing, sorting).
10. Compute the surface area and volume of a cone.
11. Analyze and manipulate student grades.
12. Simulate arithmetic operations without using standard operators.
